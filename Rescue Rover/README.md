Rescue Rover is an autonomous rover designed for search-and-rescue simulations. It navigates a defined area using infrared and ultrasonic sensors, avoids obstacles, and identifies target objects by color 
with an RGB sensor. When it detects the goal object, it signals with a buzzer and LCD display, pausing until the object is removed. Powered by multiple Arduinos communicating with each other, the rover 
integrates LEDs, buttons, and a potentiometer for enhanced interaction. This project combines obstacle avoidance, color detection, and autonomous navigation, creating a compact system inspired by industrial 
rescue and mining rovers, while functioning independently once loaded with their programs.
